            This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") governs access to and use of the Aiven Rental

          <h3>1) License</h3>
          <p>
            We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use
            the Service for your internal business operations, subject to this Agreement.
          </p>

          <h3>2) Accounts and access</h3>
          <p>
            You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all
            activity that occurs under your account. You must promptly notify your administrator if you
            suspect unauthorized use.
          </p>

          <h3>3) Acceptable use</h3>
          <p>
            You may not misuse the Service, attempt to access systems without authorization, interfere
            with security or integrity, or upload content that is unlawful or infringes on the rights of
            others.
          </p>

          <h3>4) Data and content</h3>
          <p>
            You retain ownership of your data. You grant us permission to host, process, and display your
            data only as needed to provide the Service.
          </p>

          <h3>5) Third-party services</h3>
          <p>
            The Service may integrate with third-party services (for example, mapping or accounting
            providers). Your use of those services is governed by their terms.
          </p>

          <h3>6) Termination</h3>
          <p>
            We may suspend or terminate access for violation of this Agreement or to protect the Service.
            You may stop using the Service at any time.
          </p>

          <h3>7) Disclaimer</h3>
          <p>
            The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or
            implied, including fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.
          </p>

          <h3>8) Limitation of liability</h3>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for indirect, incidental,
            special, consequential, or punitive damages, or loss of profits, data, or goodwill.
          </p>

          <h3>9) Governing law</h3>
          <p>
            This Agreement is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Service operator is
            established, without regard to conflict of law principles.
          </p>

          <h3>10) Changes</h3>
          <p>
            We may update this Agreement from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes
            become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Agreement.
