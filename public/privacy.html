          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how the Aiven Rental application (the "Service") collects, uses,
            and shares information when you access the Service hosted at
            <strong>https://rent-soft-m7b3.onrender.com</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3>1) Information we collect</h3>
          <p>
            We collect information you provide directly, such as company details, user profiles, customer
            records, equipment inventories, and rental orders. We also collect basic usage data needed to
            operate and secure the Service.
          </p>

          <h3>2) How we use information</h3>
          <p>
            We use information to provide and improve the Service, operate core features (like inventory,
            dispatching, and billing), prevent abuse, and respond to support requests.
          </p>

          <h3>3) Sharing and disclosure</h3>
          <p>
            We do not sell personal information. We may share information with service providers that
            support the Service (for example, hosting or email delivery) and when required by law.
          </p>

          <h3>4) Data retention</h3>
          <p>
            We retain data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service.
            Upon request, we will delete or anonymize data unless retention is required by law.
          </p>

          <h3>5) Security</h3>
          <p>
            We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect data.
            However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
          </p>

          <h3>6) Your choices</h3>
          <p>
            You can access, update, or delete your information through your account or by contacting your
            administrator. If you need additional help, contact support through your account administrator.
          </p>

          <h3>7) Third-party services</h3>
          <p>
            If you connect third-party integrations, those services have their own privacy practices. We
            recommend reviewing their policies.
          </p>

          <h3>8) Changes</h3>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Service after
            changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
